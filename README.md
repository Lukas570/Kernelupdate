# Kernelupdate
Script to install the latest Kernel from Kernel.org

Easy to use and foolproof way to update your Linux-Kernel!

How to use:

chmod +x Kernelupdate // changes permission to make it executable on your machine


./Kernelupdate  // Executes the file

I tested the Script on multiple Debian-based Distros (Debian, Kali etc...).
If you are using Ubuntu please tell me if the script worked for you or not. I wasn't able to compile the Kernel completely on Ubuntu-Studio it failed after a while.
If you have a fix for this or maybe have suggestions how to extend this script even further let me know!
